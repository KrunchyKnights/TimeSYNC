    <p class="desc">
        TimeSYNC is all about making your life easier. How many times have you had to plan a
        meeting time for a group project or a work meeting only for it to take way longer than expected.
        Instead of sending countless numbers of emails and text messages exchanging when you are available to meet
        and when you cannot, join timeSYNC and let us do all the work. Just input your regular, weekly schedule,
        create a group and let us do all the work to find the idea time for your group to meet.
    </p>

<div class="aboutUS" style="background-color: royalblue"><b>WHO WE ARE</b>
    <p class="desc">
        The team behind timeSYNC is five friends who came together to complete a group project in one of their
        university classes. They quickly realized that between their busy school schedules, work, and extracurricular
        activities, it was extremely difficult to come up with a time where they could all meet that they were happy
        with. They wanted any easy way to communicate with each other and to plan meetings so they decided to come up
        with timeSYNC. A web app that allows you to input your schedule and create meeting times with other people
        based on a time where everyone is free.

<div class="aboutUS" style="background-color: mediumpurple"><b>OUR GOAL</b>
    <p class="desc">
        Our goal at timeSYNC is to make lives easier. We know how busy people are and we want to take the stress out
        planning events out of your life. Whether you are using our app for scheduling work meetings, school project
        meeting times or even just scheduling lunch with a friend, we hope to be your number one choice when it comes
        to planning your next meeting.
